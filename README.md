# README

This project started with following the [Rails Guides]("https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html") to start up a blog. This was to introduce me to Rails  and start wrapping my head around the MVC (model, view, controller).

The second part was to deploy this blog to hosting provider, in this case [fly.io]("https://fly.io/"), to learn about the process of having your rails app hosted on the web.
